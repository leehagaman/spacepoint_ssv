Some tests looking for missed second shower that was misclustered as a cosmic ray using Wire-Cell 3D cosmic spacepoints. We downsample the cosmic spacepoints for efficiency. This type of tool could be useful for single photon searches in MicroBooNE and other LArTPCs. 

Similar idea to the Second Shower Veto (SSV) used in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 111801 (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.111801).
